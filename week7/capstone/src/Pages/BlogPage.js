         <details><summary>The Dybbuk Box</summary>
                <p class='blogP'>Dybbuk is from Jewish Mythology it is a malevolent wandering spirit that can posses a living persons body or an object.
                    It is said that these spirts can be brought to this side, the world of the living, by black cats or black dogs.
                    The orginal owner was Havela, she was a Holocaust survivor who lived to be 103, after her passing her grand daughter
                    place the old wine cabint in and estate sale, where a man names Kevin Minnis bought it. Helenas granddaufhter informed Mr.Kevin
                    that what he purcured was inface a Dybbuk box, and that her grandmother warned to never open it for it held an evil spirt.
                    Of course he did not heed her warning. Upon opening the cabinet, he found a series of strange objects inside: two U.S. wheat pennies
                    dating to 1925 and 1928, two locks of hair, a dried rosebud, a four-legged candlestick, a golden wine cup, and a granite sculpture 
                    inscribed with the Hebrew word shalom. The Shema, a prayer considered to be one of the most important in Judaism, was carved on the back of the cabinet.
                    Not minding what he found in the cabinet he then he cleaned it up and decided to give it to his mom as a birthday gift.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">According to a 2012 interview
                    when she opened the cabinet she was met with a blast of cold air and then immediately had a stroke. Of course after this she no longer wanted the box and
                    asked her son to take it back. He tried to give the box away to different family members. He gave it to his sister and after only a week, she complained 
                    that the doors would open on thir own. Then he gave it to his brother who in turn only kept it for three days because his wife said it smelt like cat pee.
                    So now moving outside of the family he sold it to an older couple. Not suprising they brought it back after only three days and left it infront of his antique shop.
                    Kevin could not seem to get rid of this box, so he brought it home. it did take long for him to see what everyone else had been talking about. He begain to see things,
                    shadow figures, having crazy dream about a demonic old lady who would beat him up. If that wasnt bad enought he would wake up covered in bruses. He had all he could take
                    of this demon box and did what any logical person would do... try to sale it on eBay. Well it took about three years (whats with all these threes??) but he ended up 
                    saling it to a collage student from Missori. It wasnt very long before the poor collage student beagn having the same problems. They even woke up to a swarm of bugs that
                    were all over the box. After that his mental health was on a decline. After only eight months he put the box back up for sale online. Where a man named Jason bought the box
                    so he could study it. Jason worked at a museum, so he brought the box there and almost instantly they could feel the effects of the box. Computers would die and along with
                    them some important information would be never be recorved. So the museum asked Jason to get rid of the box. So like some crazy skeptic he brought the box home. It wasnt 
                    very long before he began seeing the shadow people and having the nightmare about the demonic old lady beating him up. But the siencest in him said you know what who cares 
                    I still want to study this. He reached ou to Wickens, Rabbis, paranormal experts. He even tested the box for biohazoreds or anything to explain what was going on, but all the 
                    test cam back negative. But the experts instructed him to contain the box by putting it in somthing lined with gold to nutrilize the spirt. Believe it or not it actually worked.
                    Then Jason finally got smart and burried the box in an undisclosed location. In the nine months that followed Jason wrote a book about this Dybbuk Box and all the cray things he 
                    expierenced, he even reached out to some of the previous oweners. On this journey he was able to get in contact with a family member of the orginal owner of the box. That family member 
                    told them how the evil spirt come to be in that box. Helena accidently let that evil spirt in the world while tring to get good spirts to come over to our side and help help fight 
                    againt the Nazi forces. She used this wine cabnit to capture the evil spirt. Helena has had the box since then and that is why she told her family to never open the box. Her family listened 
                    but as we have just seen they are the only ones. So now that Jason has all this information he published his book. In 2004 Sam Remy announced that he was going to make a movie based on
                    Jasons book called The Possession. But that is not where out story ends. In 2017 Zack Bagans from Ghost Adventures reached out to Jason and bought the cursed box and put it in his self named 
                    museum in Vegas. The box is still on display there today. Are you brave enough to be in the same room as this evil box?</span>

                <p class='blogP'>
                  <span id= "h"><span id="w"><span id="t">Trigger Warning</span>: this case contains violance and rape</span></span>
                  This is a pretty gnarley case so buckle up! We are going to talk about the Milwaukee cannibal. He was born on May 21, 1960, his name Jeffrey Dahmer. His was born to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer, his dad was a research chemist
                  meaning he wasnt really around all that much when Jeff was growning up. His mom was a Teletype machine instructor (I didnt know what that was at first but it was like a telegraph/typewriter/early computers made to send messages)
                  So his struggled with depression and maybe some other mental conditions, she was a bit of a hypercondriac, at one point she did attempt suicide by overdosing on pills. Now on most accounts Jeff was described as an energetic and happy kid.
                  So everything was peachy until he turned 4, he was diagnosed with a double hernia. So this of course this had to be corrected, but no one really explained this surgey to Jeff, they kind of just brought him to the hospital and said 
                  your having surgery! So being a 4 year old im sure that was super scary and traumatizing. So after this he was no longer the happy ahild he was before. He was very withdrawn and would sit for hours and not say a word. Then the Dahmer's 
                  welcomed a new baby into the world his name was David. So Joyce with a new baby and struggling with her mental health did not leave much time for Jeffrey, the poor baby probably felt neglected, but his life goes on. As he got older Jeff 
                  showed a real intrest in bones. His dad being a research chemist was like cool we can bond over this. At dinner Jeff asked his dad what would happen if I put chicken bones in bleach?<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more1">Lionel was like you know what lets do an experiment.
                  So being a super cool dad he showed Jeff the process of bleach bones and what happens when you do it. At this young age his classmates said that he would show up to school drunk, he would even have a flask in his locker. His classmates would discribe him as a loner but also a class clown. 
                  He would even sneak into club yearbook photos at he wasnt even a part of. Fast forward again, Jeff is in high school, his fantasies of domination and rape are on full blast. When he thought about sex he didnt want his partner to move.
                  He also realised that he was gay. Which in the 60s was not allowed! Now around this time Jeff took notice of a male jogger that would run down the road near his house, Jeff thought he was attractive. This jogger became the subject of Jeffs rape fantasies.
                  Before long the fantasies werent enought so Jeff decided to get a baseball bat and hide in the bushes near the joggers path, he was going to knock the guy out and live out his sick dream. But just so happens the jogger didnt go for a run on this day, which
                  really saved his life! Moving on in 1978 Dahmers parents finally got divorced after years of an on the rocks marriage. Durring this time David the younger brother went to live with Joyce, and Jeff stayed with Lionel.
                  Now Jeffs dad had a girlfried and they lived together at her house, meaning that Jeff was pretty much left alone...abandoned in this house. A 17 year old boy alone in a house what could go wrong right? In this house alone is where Jeff commited his first murder!
                  He is now 18 and his fantasies have evolved again, now he dreams of picking up a hitch-hicker raping and murdering him. So what did Jeff do, he was driving down the road and saw a young man walking. This unlucky young man is Steven Mark Hicks, he was 18 years old
                  and on his way to a rock concert. Somehow Jeff was able to convence Steven to come back to his house, where they drank beer and hung out even had consensual sex. Then Steven told Jeffrey that he wanted to leave, that didnt fly with Jeff. So what did he do you ask,
                  well he hit him over the head with a dumbbell, then strangled him. But the crazy doesnt stop there he then stripped Steven and masterbated over his dead body and went to bed. In the morning he decided to dissect the body, he cut this poor boy into pieces and burried
                  in the back yard. In fear of being cought two weeks later he dug up the body, stripped his skin off and fluched the it down the toilet, then boiled the bones in acid, crushed them with a hammer and spread the dust in the woods. See his dads teaching come back to him 
                  in a bad way!! After all this Jeff went to collage and carried on with his "normal" life. Well that was until he flunked out of hos first simester! Lionel was like yo Jeff you need to do something with your life so he joined the army! That straightened him out right...
                  no. no it did not. A fellow soldier come forward years later and said that Dahmer repeatedly raped him over a 17 month pierod. In 1981 Jeff was formily discharged from service due to alcoholism. He was to scared to go home and tell his dad what happened so he did the 
                  next most logical thing and moved to Miami, and got a job at a sandwich shop. That didnt last long with the drinking and all. Eventually he went back to Ohio and moved in with his dad and now new wife. Lionel's wife hated Jeff and his continuous drinking, so beofre long 
                  they sent him off to live with his grandmother in Wisconsin. Things didnt get better! In 1982 Jeff was arrested for indecent exposure. He was arrested again in 1986 when two boys accused him of masturbating in front of them, he got 1 year probation. Moving forward Jeff
                  need money for booze so he got a job at a chocolate factory. At this time Jeff would frequent gay bars and bath houses you know living his best life. Just kidding his messed up fantasies were back again and he would look at the men around him and think humm i want to sleep 
                  with these guys...oh yea and I want them to be dead when I do it. So to make his dreams come true he would drug his partners and rape them. Some time later in 1987 Jeffrey picked up his next victum at a bar, his name was Steven Tuomi he was 25 years old. Jeff brought him
                  back to a hotel room he was renting, where he planned to drug and rape him, and he did. But the next morning Jeff woke up to beaten and dead Steven and his own knuckles were brused and bloody. Later Jeff would say that he was so black out drunk he didnt remember commiting
                  this crime. So now he has to get rid of the body so he went and got 2 large suitcases then brought them home to his gradmothers house. He ended up keeping the body for a few days before he dismembered and disposed of it, well not all of it he kept Stevens head. He kept his head 
                  for about 2 weeks before he boiled and bleached it so he could keep it to masterbate to. But to Dahmers dismay the skull was to brittle and he had to smash it up and get rid of it. Dahmer went on to kill 2 more people. Then in 1989 Jeff lured  Anthony Sears to his grandmothers 
                  basment where he drugged, strangled, sodomized, photographed, and dismembered him. For a few years Dahmer laid low, but that didnt last long his body count went from 5 to 17. Lets fast forward to when Dahmer go cought. A 32-year-old African American man, Tracy Edwards was 
                  found wandering the streets with handcuffs dangling from his wrist. Police were called and when they arrived Tracy told them some dude had drugged him, tried to restrain him, and threatened him with a knife. The cops brought Tracy back to Dahmers appartment to get the keys 
                  to the handcuffs. After arriving Tracy said that the knife that Jeff used to threaten him was in the bedroom. So police decided to take a look, thats when they made a grizzly discovery, polaroid pictures of dismembered bodies lying around. Thats when cops finally got it right
                  and arrested him! Upon going back to Jeffs appartment they found a head in the refrigerator, three more in the freezer and a catalog of other horrors, including preserved skulls, jars containing genitalia and an extensive gallery of his victims. Now we get to Jeffrey's trial,
                  in 1992 this is were the details of Jeffery's crimes come to light. How he brutalized his victumes, ate them, and cook their skulls and keep them as souvenirs. He was sentenced to 16 consecutive life terms in prison. Jeff did last for to long in prision,
                  he was brutally beaten to death in 1994, by a fellow inmate Christopher Scarver.

     <details><summary>Dispappearance of Bryce Laspisa</summary>
                <p class='blogP'>
                    Bryce Laspisa was born on April 30, 1994 in Illinois, Springfield to parents Karen and Michael Laspisa. Our story starts after Bryce graduated from high school in 2012, that summer his family moved to Laguna Niguel, California.
                    But Bryce insted moved to Chico, which was 450 miles away, to attend Sierra College. During this time he made a number of new friends one in which was Sean Dixon, his roommate. He also started dating blond named Kim Sly.
                    Between his freshmen and sophomore year he spent the summer with his parents. WHo by all accounts said he was acting like his normal self. Two weeks into the simester Karen, Bryce's mom, recieved a call from his roommate 
                    telling her Bryce's personality has completely changed. He was staying up all night drinking and taking an ADHD medication called Vyvanse, which was not perscribed to him. Karen called Bryce to check in on him he was attending classes like normal
                    and everything seemed fine. At this same time his girlfried Kim started to notice some changes in Bryce as well, he sent her a message saying she would be better off without him. So like an normal person she asked him are you breaking up with me?
                    he said yes! That same day Kim was like hold on im coming to your appartment and we are going to talk about this. Thankfully they made up, but to her he was still acting strange, he then admitted that he had taken a Vyvanse pill.
                    The following day Bryce was on the phone with his mom and he confided in er that he was going to go break it off with Kim...again! Karen found this to be odd, as far as she knew her son was head over heels in love with Kim. Later that day he sent a 
                    message to his roommate "Love you bro,seriously you are the best person I have ever met you saved my soul." minutes later Sean replied "I love you too man, you have an amazing life full of love and blessings dont waste that. You have to many people that love you Bryce."
                    To be it sounds like Sean is being a good friend, like im here if you need me. Now back to breaking up with Kim it was about 10:00 at night when Bryce arrives at Kims house. Kim recalls the convsation being weird and that Bryce was acting strange and talking about breaking up again.
                    She could feel somthing was off, not because he was breaking up with for a second time, somthing just seemd off. She did not think he sould be driving, so she took his keys and wouldnt give them back. She then called his mom with him standing there to voice her concern.
                    Now this is the second call Karen recieved about her son acting strange. Kim gave the phone to Bryce, his mom asked if everting was ok, he said he was fine and Kim was just mad about the break up and wouldnt give him his keys. Karen told him look im am just going to fly up there tomorrow,
                    he told her to calm down dont come down here until i call you later, I have alot to talk to you about. Karen told Kim to give him the keys back he is fine. So around 11:30 Bryce left Kim's presumably to head home.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more2">But around 1:30 Karen got a call from her son, he said that he was still on the road.
                    Which was strange he sould have been home by now ,but according to cell tower pings he had gone south the opisite direction to his collage appartment. The next morning at 11:00 his mom gets another call but this time form her insurance company that the road side assistance was used for Bryces car.
                    After getting this call Karen called Sean to ask about the insurance call, thats when Sean informed her that Bryce never cam home. Now in full panice his parent began checking their bank accounts to see if Bryce used his credit card. Luck would have it he did, there was a $20.00 charge in a town
                    called Button Willow which was about 3 hours from there house so maybe he was headed home. Durning this time thay tried to call Bryce but were not getting any answer. Panic ridden again. Bryces dad called the business that the card was used at, it was a tire and truck shop, to see if maybe they 
                    remember seeing Bryce. When he called a young man named Christan answered, he said he did remember Bryce he had brought him three gallons of gas to a boy matching his discription around 9:00am on side of the road. Christan being an amazing person can hear hte painc in the parents voices and offers 
                    to go back to where the brought Bryce the gas hours earlier to see if he was still there. So he drive back to the location and what does he find...give up.. its Bryce in his car still sitting in the same place he was three hours before. At this pont Christan calls Bryce's parents back to say he found 
                    their son in the same place as before and he gave the phone to Bryce. He talks to his parents they are asking him what is going on, he said nothing, Karen then told him to go fill up his car and come home. Bryce does as he is told and fills his car up and off he went. Well a few hours had passed and 
                    his parents thought he sould be home by now and he still isnt. In panic yet again they called the police and filled a missing persons report. Police were able to get Bryce's location from his cell phone ping... wanna guess where he was... you guessed it in Butten Willow, just miles from where 
                    he was 9 hours before. Police show up to find him sitting in his car outside of a hotel, they tested him to see if he was on drugs/drunk. He passed. They told him is parents were worried and asked him to call them. THe phone call was off. When asked what he was doing he said he was going to chill 
                    with friends late. Wait what you are in the middle of nowhere what friends where? The cops got on the phone and said Bryce was ok to drive and they left. Hours passed and thier sone was still not home. So they called teh God sent Angel Christan, and asked him if he would be willing to go see if Bryce 
                    was still where the cops left him. Shocker he was still there it has now been 13 hours. Christan said he would make Bryce follow him onto hte interstate so they knew he was on his way home. So Bryce is moving and now on the interstate. At 2:00am he calles his mom and tells her he is still driving but
                    he is tired so he is going to pull over and sleep in his car. Karen told him that was a good idea. At this point he has been awake for almost 36 hours. The next morning California Police showed up at Karens house, to inform her that her sons car was found abandoned and over turned off an embankment near a lake.
                    All of Byrces things were found in the car, his phone, laptop, wallet, and clothes. They did not find much blood at the scene so they think he was ok and walked away from the accident. So to get to this embankment he had to take a service road and there was a camara to take pictures of people going up this road.
                    There were two pictures of Bryce's car one at  2:15 am, which he did not stop when he told his mom he did, and another picture at 4:30am. This road is long and winding but he was headed in the same direction both times? Why? We dont know. There was a hugh search that went on for weeks. The only evidence that was found
                    was via a sniffer dog tnat followed his scent to a truck stop that was throught the woods from the over turned car. But after that nothing the trail went cold. The search was sadly called off after 3 weeks. ANd Bryce was never seen again. What happend to Bryce did he hit is head and forget who he was? did he get taken?
                    Was he killed to this day there are still no answers.</span>

                <p class='blogP'>
                    You are walking down a dark road in sotheren Louisiana. The only light you see is from the full moon hanging high in the sky. You hear a noise off to your side, you stop and peer into the dark, scanning. Your gaze falls on a giant set of glowing red eyes! Before you can process what you are seeing,
                    a large man like figure lunges towards you. As the figure moves into the light you can see a wolf like face and a body coved in patches of fur. You now find yourself in the clutches of a Rougarou. What is a Rougarou you may ask, well we have to take a trip down the bayou all the way to Louisiana.
                    Louisiana is a mix of French backgrounds, that is where the term loup-garou came from. Loup mening wolf and garou meaning wearwolf. The term Rougarou we are using here is just a variant of the pronunciation. This tale comes from the Cathlic Chruch, to inspire obedience during Lent.
                    It was said that if you were to break Lent for seven years in a row a witch would tur you into a loup-garou.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more3">It was later used as a cautionary tale for young children to make them listen to their parent, because if not the Rougarou would take you away. The most common places to see or run into this beast
                    insugar cane fields, swamps, and woodland areas, which incase you didnt know is everywhere in Louisiana. Now lets talk about the curse itself, it is said to only last 101 days, but only if you can keep it a secret, if you tell someone you will be a Rougarou forever. There are several ways to pass the cures onto another, 
                    to while in Rougarou form someone has to cut you deep enough to draw blood, you will then return to your human form, but before you run away you must tell the one that wounded you your name, now your life as a Rougarou is finished because you passed the curse to another. If you look a Rougarou in the eyes the 
                    eyes, the eyes are the window to the soul, so it is thought that the curse can be passed this way too. Now there has to be a way to stop this creature right. Well there is but it is not in the way you may be thinking. The best way to deture this beast is to place 13 items like pennies at your door step,
                    the Rougarou can not count past 12, not sure why, but its said to keep it so confused it can not pass. You can even put a rice colander infront of your door and the Rougarou will stay there all night tring to count all the wholes, since it cant get past 12 it will saty until day break then it will return
                    back to the woods. Crazy right this giant man wolf can take lives but can not count to 13. If you are from the south you know and fear this monster. This being said in Houma every year we do celebrate this legand, its called Rougarou Fest where people can dress up and eat good sotheren cajun cooking. 
                    So if you ever found yourself in South Louisiana keep an eye out and always keep 13 pennies in your pocket and hope you dont run in our local legand the Rougarou!!! </span>
