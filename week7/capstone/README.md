    This page uses several different components. The AddForm which is used to add new podcast to a list for later use. The DeleteForm and the EditForm which allows you to remove and update that same information. All of the information that is here is being kept track of with the use of state and the useState hook.

--final thoughts 

This project was a tough one originally, I was looking to use the Spotify API which proved to be more difficult than I could have ever imagined. So sadly, I had to settle for a self-made database to store the links to the podcast episodes that can be found on Spotify. The hardest part with the use of a self-made database was the proxying of the localhost. But it runs without error after a lot group effort! 




A big Thank you goes out to the Bryan University Tutors! Giselle and Nadia. For all the countless hours of their patients and willingness to help! 





<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
